I am Sayyam Sawai, a rising junior at the University of Minnesota! I am currently learning and tinkering with audio encoding and their use in transformer models as part of my research at the U, alongside, I try and implement any research papers I find interesting. I also love working on other things that interest me, ranging anywhere from low-level stuff like FPGAs to FrontEnd Development.
