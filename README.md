I am Sayyam Sawai, a rising sophomore at the University of Minnesota! I am generally interested in working on AI/ML stuff and have been currently exploring the field of AI safety. I also work on other things that interest me, ranging anywhere from low-level stuff like FPGAs to FrontEnd Development.
